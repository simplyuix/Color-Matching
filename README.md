This IOS APP is made Using CHAT GPT 

 --------
**ME:**
Create a fun iOS app in SwiftUI that does colour matching. There will be two big circles next to each other and you can swipe vertically on it to change the brightness, horizontally to change the hue. Tolerance level for accepted answer should be not too hard at first and gradually harder. There should be a timer, and you have 10 secs to answer. There should be a button to submit answer below.
